# Contributing to Revision App

First off, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

-   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues).
-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement. Clearly state the enhancement's purpose and your proposed implementation.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
-   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

-   Follow the existing code style.
-   For this project, we use Prettier for automatic code formatting. Please run `npm run format` (or a similar command) before committing.

We appreciate your contributions!
